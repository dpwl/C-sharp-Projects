- __Description__:<br>
A program that helps users to have a temprature unit conversion.
A user will be asked to type in the unit that they'd like to start with.
In here, two choices will be shown explicitly, however, if the user enters invalid value or the value outside of the given choices, they will receive error message.<br>
If they choose one of the choices given, the prompt will ask user to enter the value of temperature in double. If the user types any non-numeric values, they will receive an error message saying the input is not double number, asking users to try again. When the proper double value of temperature is given, the result of temperature conversion will be shown, and the program will ask users if wanting to continue to another conversion or not. Depending on user's answer either Y(Yes) or N(No), the program will start from the beginning, or the program will end.
